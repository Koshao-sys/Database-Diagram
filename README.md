# 📖 [Vet clinic database: add database schema diagram] <a name="about-project"></a>

> Use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic.

**[database schema diagram]** 
My coding partner and I have just completed a project where we were tasked with interpreting a database diagram and implementing the necessary SQL statements to build the database. We started by thoroughly analyzing the diagram to understand its structure and relationships between different entities. Then, we wrote SQL code to create the database schema, including tables, columns, keys, and indexes, following the diagram's specifications. We also ensured data integrity and consistency by defining constraints, such as foreign key relationships and unique constraints. Finally, we tested the database by inserting sample data and verifying that all queries and operations were working as expected. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding project that required both analytical and technical skills.

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema_based_on_diagram.sql](./schema_based_on_diagram.sql) to create all tables.
<!--- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**-->
